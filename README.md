## Requirements
* Python 3
* CUDA
* numpy
* tqdm
* [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) (1.2)
* [torchvision](http://pytorch.org/)  
Recommend: the environment can be established by running

```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```


## Data preparation
1. Download the [i3d features]([link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Cn1BDw6EnjlMbBINkbxHSQ password: u4k6])(https://drive.google.com/file/d/193jToyF8F5rv1SCgRiy_zbW230OrVkuT/view?usp=sharing) and change the "dataset_path" to you/path/data

## Visual Feature Extraction
if you want to extract Visual Feature like this project, you can clone this project([https://github.com/wanboyang/anomaly_feature])


## Training

```
python main.py
```
The models and testing results will be created on ./ckpt and ./results respectively
